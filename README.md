## Options
The options that can be set before exporting:

* The playlists to export (one or more can be chosen).
* The location in which to export.
* The method in which to export multiple playlists:
  * Same folder - Creates a new folder and places all songs from all playlists there. All m3u playlist files are saved to a subfolder.
  * Different folders - Makes separate subfolders for each playlist. The m3u playlist is saved in this folder, and a further subfolder is made for the media files.
* The folder structure and filename rules to use for the media files.
  * Can use the iTunes metadata. Available attributes are: `[album]`, `[album artist]`, `[artist]`, `[composer]`, `[track name]`, `[track number]`, `[disc number]`, `[playlist order number]`, `[original file name]`.
  * These attributes can be used to form the folder structure and filename.  
      For example: `[artist] > [album] > [track number] - [track name]`  
        - This will create `<export location>/<playlist name>/[artist]/[album]/file.extension`.  
        - The file will be renamed to `[track number] - [track name]`, and its original extension will be kept.

## Why use the script?

iTunes already has an option to export a playlist. This creates a playlist file in several formats (`m3u`, `xml`, etc.), but doesn't export the actual media files, which can make it difficult to use the exported playlists on other devices.

The script makes a copy of all media files in a playlist alongside the `m3u` file. However, `m3u` is the only format supported.
